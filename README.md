I’m Hope Kim, a software engineer who explores optimal solutions through challenging missions.

I work at a vertical AI fintech company, developing a BaaS platform across savings banks.

Since 2014, I’ve pursued computing with passion — from console games to nationwide SaaS and government platforms.

I focus on sustainable 80+ quality software, balancing trade-offs over perfection.

My growth path is self-driven, aligning personal direction with meaningful work.
